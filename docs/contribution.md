Readability and Maintainability: Ensure that the code is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Consider the following aspects:

Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
Break down complex code into smaller, modular functions or methods.
Follow a consistent coding style and formatting conventions.
Add comments where necessary to clarify the intent or complex sections.

Performance and Efficiency: Evaluate the code's performance and efficiency. Consider:

Unnecessary or redundant computations, loops, or database queries.
Potential memory leaks or resource-intensive operations.
Proper usage of data structures and algorithms for optimal performance.

Code Structure and Organization: Check if the code is well-structured and organized. Look for:

Proper separation of concerns and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
Avoidance of code duplication and the use of appropriate abstractions.
Consistent indentation, code grouping, and file organization.
