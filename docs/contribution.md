For contributing to the package please make sure that you follow:
Understand the Existing Codebase: Familiarize yourself with the structure and organization of the current chart package. Gain an understanding of the available chart types, data models, and rendering techniques. Study how the current Chart widget and its rendering pipeline work, how it handles the coordinate system, the gestures, etc. for more information you can refer to this documentation.

Plan the Architecture: Consider the best approach for implementing the new features within the existing package architecture. Determine if it's necessary to introduce new widgets, data models, or rendering techniques. Evaluate the impact on performance, code organization, and maintainability. One key factor is to make the Chart to know less about what it is rendering and have a consistent rendering step and depend on abstraction to function.

Define a Clear API: define a clear and intuitive API for adding new features. Consider how the users of the package will interact with the new functionality and design an API that is consistent with the existing package conventions.

Write Unit Tests: Ensure that your modifications and new features are thoroughly tested by writing unit tests. Test both the visual representation and the underlying functionality of the charts. Aim for comprehensive test coverage to catch any potential regressions.

Handle Customization: Consider adding configuration options or callbacks to enable users to modify chart behavior.

Consider Performance: Optimize performance by implementing techniques such as caching, rendering only visible data points, or utilizing hardware acceleration when possible. Ensure that the package performs well on different devices and handles large datasets efficiently.

Documentation and Examples: Update the documentation and provide clear examples for using the new features or modifications. Include explanations of the API, usage scenarios, and any required configurations. Illustrate the expected results and provide sample code to help users of the package or other contributors to understand how to integrate the new functionality.

Test on Real Financial Data: Validate the functionality and accuracy of the financial chart package by testing it with real financial data. Ensure that the charts can handle various data patterns, such as irregular time intervals, different chart types, and large data ranges.

When the new functionality is ready for review please do a self-review first before passing to review.
Please make sure all Dart analysis warnings in your changes are fixed and all the tests are passed.
Can run the following commands before passing to review:
```
flutter analyze
flutter test
```


Readability and Maintainability: Ensure that the code is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Consider the following aspects:

Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
Break down complex code into smaller, modular functions or methods.
Follow a consistent coding style and formatting conventions.
Add comments where necessary to clarify the intent or complex sections.

Performance and Efficiency: Evaluate the code's performance and efficiency. Consider:

Unnecessary or redundant computations, loops, or database queries.
Potential memory leaks or resource-intensive operations.
Proper usage of data structures and algorithms for optimal performance.

Code Structure and Organization: Check if the code is well-structured and organized. Look for:

Proper separation of concerns and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
Avoidance of code duplication and the use of appropriate abstractions.
Consistent indentation, code grouping, and file organization.

Polymorphism: with example, avoid using String in switch cases as much as possible.
