# Chart Types

Flutter Chart supports multiple chart types to visualize your financial data effectively.

## Line Chart
A line chart connects data points with straight lines, ideal for showing price trends over time.

## Candlestick Chart
Candlestick charts show price movements using "candlesticks". Each candlestick represents four price points:
- Opening price
- Closing price
- High price
- Low price

## Area Chart
Area charts are similar to line charts but with the area below the line filled, useful for visualizing volume or cumulative data.
