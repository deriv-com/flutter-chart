/// An abstract class that defines the behavior of crosshair in charts.
///
/// The CrosshairBehaviour class provides a set of methods to customize how
/// crosshair elements are displayed and interact with the chart. Different
/// implementations of this class can provide varying behaviours for different
/// chart types (like line charts vs candlestick charts) or different screen sizes.
///
/// The generic type parameter T extends Tick and represents the type of data
/// that the crosshair will interact with.
abstract class CrosshairBehaviour<T extends Tick> {
  /// Creates a custom painter for the crosshair lines.
  ///
  /// Retrieves the information widget to be displayed in the crosshair tooltip.
  ///
  /// This method generates a widget that displays information about the data point
  /// where the crosshair is positioned. The information typically includes values
  /// like price, volume, or other relevant data from the tick.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [mainSeries]: The main data series of the chart
  /// - [crosshairTick]: The tick data at the crosshair position
  /// - [pipSize]: Number of decimal places to display in price values
  /// - [theme]: The chart theme containing styling information
  ///
  /// Returns a widget that displays the crosshair information.

  /// - [dateText]: The formatted date string to display
  /// - [style]: The text style to apply to the label

  /// - [dotColor]: The fill color of the dot (default: Color(0xFF85ACB0))

  /// - [content]: The widget to display inside the label
