/// Renders a vertical dashed line with a flag icon to indicate the end time of a contract.
///
/// This function draws a vertical dashed line at the specified horizontal position,
/// extending from near the top of the chart to near the bottom. The line visually
/// marks the end time of a contract or trade on a financial chart. It also renders
/// a flag icon near the bottom of the line.
///
/// The function performs two main rendering operations:
/// 1. Draws a vertical dashed line using the `paintVerticalDashedLine` helper function
/// 2. Renders a flag icon near the bottom of the chart
///
/// The vertical line uses the background color from the provided style, and the icon
/// is styled according to the marker style with appropriate scaling based on the zoom factor.
///
/// @param canvas The canvas on which to paint the line and icon.
/// @param size The size of the drawing area, used to determine the vertical extent of the line.
/// @param marker The chart marker (kept for signature parity with start line painter).
/// @param anchor The position on the canvas where the line should be anchored.
/// @param style The marker style, which provides colors and icon styling information.
/// @param zoom The zoom factor to apply to icon size and other dimensions.
