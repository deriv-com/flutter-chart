/// A model class that encapsulates chart scaling information.
///
/// `ChartScaleModel` holds essential scaling parameters that determine how chart
/// data is mapped to the visual space. It provides the foundation for consistent
/// scaling across different components of the chart visualization system.
///
/// This model is used by various chart components to ensure that visual elements
/// (such as candles, lines, markers, and annotations) are rendered at the appropriate
/// scale and position. It helps maintain visual consistency as the user zooms,
/// pans, or otherwise interacts with the chart.
///
/// The primary scaling parameters are:
/// - `msPerPx`: The horizontal scale (milliseconds per pixel)
/// - `granularity`: The time interval between consecutive data points
///
/// From these primary parameters, derived values like the zoom factor can be calculated,
/// which are used to scale visual elements appropriately.
class ChartScaleModel {
  /// Creates a new chart scale model with the specified scaling parameters.
  ///
  /// @param granularity The time interval (in milliseconds) between consecutive data points.
  ///        This is a required parameter as it's fundamental to the chart's time scale.
  /// @param msPerPx The number of milliseconds represented by one pixel on the x-axis.

  /// how many milliseconds of time are represented by each pixel of horizontal space.
  /// Lower values result in a more "zoomed in" view (more pixels per time unit),
  /// while higher values result in a more "zoomed out" view (fewer pixels per time unit).
  ///
  /// For example:
  /// - A value of 60000 means each pixel represents 1 minute
  /// - A value of 3600000 means each pixel represents 1 hour

  /// - 1000: 1 second between points

  /// and mapping it to a range that's appropriate for visual scaling (0.8 to 1.2).
