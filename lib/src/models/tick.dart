/// Basic data entry.
// Since we have field option in indicators menu (Close, High, Hl2, etc),
// and since sometimes we have Tick data and sometimes Candle, We didn't want us
// to have to check if it is a <Tick>[] use something like QuoteIndicator(ticks)
// as input for Indicators that do the calculation and if it's a <Candle>[] use
// Close|High|Hl2|ValueIndicator(ticks).
// To avoid doing this check, we made Tick class comply with OHLC interface. So
// we can use either <Tick>[] or <Candle>[] as input for
// Close|High|Hl2|ValueIndicators.
